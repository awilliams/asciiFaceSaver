# Ascii Faces Screen Saver

### About

This is built in swift, fun stuff, yay etc etc

### Adding a face

I'm totally happy with people contributing their own faces, here's a little wrap up of the steps involved!

1. Check that the face doesn't exist. (cmd + f)
2. Add your face in `asciiFaceManager.swift`
3. Build, and confirm that the face renders nicely.
4. Commit, and include ascii face in the commit message, eg: `add: (ง'̀-'́)ง`
5. Create pull request, include the face in that as well, just like the commit message.

Awesome! I'll merge it in, and create a new build.
